# Write Like Me

A free, serverless tool that analyzes your writing samples and creates a detailed writing profile. Use that profile to generate new text in your unique style, free of common AI writing patterns.

**Live Demo:** [https://97115104.github.io/writelikeme/](https://97115104.github.io/writelikeme/)

## What It Does

Write Like Me solves the "AI slop" problem. When you use AI to generate text, it often sounds generic, formulaic, and obviously machine-generated. This tool analyzes your actual writing to understand your voice, then uses that understanding to generate content that sounds like you.

## Key Features

### Advanced Slop Detection & Removal

The heart of Write Like Me is its **comprehensive AI pattern detection system** based on extensive research into what makes AI writing sound artificial. The tool detects and removes:

**Critical Patterns (Always Fixed):**
- Em dashes and en dashes used as parentheticals
- Antithetical constructions ("It's not X, it's Y")
- Sycophantic phrases ("Great question!", "That's fascinating!")
- Bullet points and numbered lists (converted to flowing prose)
- Third-person self-references ("The post explores..." → "I explore...")

**High Priority Patterns:**
- Lazy declarative openers ("Here's the thing:", "The bottom line:")
- Colon-based declarations ("The answer is simple: X")
- Formulaic transitions (However, Moreover, Furthermore)
- Formulaic conclusions (In summary, At the end of the day)
- Meta-commentary ("As I mentioned above", "Let me explain")
- Rhetorical Q&A patterns
- "Real talk" openers ("Real talk:", "Full transparency:")
- Quick exit/cheap engagement lines ("not writing this for a quick exit")
- "Personal and universal" clichés

**Medium Priority Patterns:**
- Overly formal phrasing ("It is worth noting", "utilize", "leverage")
- AI vocabulary clusters (landscape, ecosystem, journey, robust)
- Forced perspective balancing ("On one hand... on the other hand")
- Passive voice constructions
- Engagement bait phrases

**Low Priority Patterns:**
- Excessive intensifiers (incredibly, absolutely, truly)
- Hedge word clusters (perhaps, maybe, might)
- Filler adjectives (various, numerous, significant)

**Formatting Issues:**
- Wall of text without paragraph breaks
- Very long paragraphs (150+ words)
- Excessive whitespace and spacing issues
- Extra long sentences (50+ words)

Generated text receives a **quality score from 0-100** showing how authentic it sounds. Text with critical or formatting issues is automatically fixed or rewritten to remove AI patterns while preserving your voice.

### Writing Profile Analysis

Share your writing samples and get a comprehensive analysis:

- **Style** — Formality level, descriptiveness, directness, perspective
- **Tone & Voice** — Primary tone, emotional register, voice consistency
- **Vocabulary** — Word complexity, characteristic words, reading level
- **Structure** — Sentence length patterns, variety, paragraph style
- **Stylistic Markers** — Unique patterns, signature phrases, punctuation preferences
- **Patterns to Replicate** — Key constructions that define your voice

### Profile Quality Metrics

Your profile is rated as **Excellent**, **Good**, **Fair**, or **Needs More** based on:
- Number of writing samples (3-5+ recommended)
- Total word count (2,000+ words recommended)
- Source variety (different types of content)

### Platform-Aware Generation

Mention a social platform in your prompt and the tool automatically adapts:

- **X/Twitter** — Ultra-brief, 1-2 sentences, punchy
- **LinkedIn** — Professional but concise, 100-200 words max
- **Instagram** — Brief captions, 1-3 sentences
- **TikTok** — Ultra-short, hook-focused
- **Threads/Bluesky** — Brief takes, 2-4 sentences
- **Facebook** — Conversational but concise
- **Reddit** — Community-aware, varies by context
- **Email/Substack** — Professional structure

For professional platforms (LinkedIn, Email), you can choose to adjust capitalization, grammar, and formality while maintaining your voice.

### One-Click Sharing

After generating content for social media, share directly:
- **Share on X** — Opens X/Twitter with your content pre-filled
- **Share on LinkedIn** — Opens LinkedIn share dialog
- **Share on Facebook** — Opens Facebook share dialog
- **Share on Reddit** — Opens Reddit submission

If your prompt mentioned a URL, it's automatically appended for clean link sharing.

### GitHub Repo Detection

GitHub repository URLs in your prompt are automatically detected. The tool fetches:
- README content
- Repository metadata (description, language, stars)

This provides rich technical context when generating content about code projects.

### Style Sketch Studio

Based on your prompt content, the tool detects and suggests relevant tones with **sentiment-coded colors**:

| Color | Sentiment | Example Styles |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 🟢 Green | Positive | Upbeat, Encouraging, Warm |
| 🟠 Orange | Warm/Nurturing | Empathetic, Understanding, Supportive |
| 🔵 Blue | Somber/Reflective | Melancholic, Thoughtful, Gentle |
| 🔴 Red | Assertive/Strong | Bold, Confrontational, Urgent |
| 🟣 Purple | Neutral/Balanced | Professional, Technical, Analytical |

**Available Styles:**
- **Accessible** — General audience, explains technical concepts simply
- **Technical** — Precise, detailed terminology for expert readers
- **Casual** — Relaxed, conversational language
- **Professional** — Polished, business-appropriate
- **Somber** — Gentle, emotionally measured for difficult topics
- **Empathetic** — Shows understanding and compassion
- **Upbeat** — Energetic, positive, celebratory
- **Witty** — Light humor and clever observations
- **Persuasive** — Compelling, action-oriented
- **Educational** — Clear explanations, step-by-step
- **Narrative** — Story structure with vivid details
- **Analytical** — Data-driven, logical reasoning
- **Concise** — Ultra-brief, every word earns its place
- **Thorough** — Comprehensive with full context
- **Warm** — Friendly, approachable, inviting
- **Understanding** — Acknowledges complexities and challenges
- **Encouraging** — Supportive, motivating, confidence-building
- **Storytelling** — Rich narrative with scene-setting

Toggle tones on/off to guide generation while preserving your core voice. Hover for descriptions. **Already-selected tags appear pre-checked** and can be toggled off.

**Predicted Impact Heuristics**: Each style shows how it might affect your output:
- Word count changes (+/- percentage)
- Sentence length shifts  
- Structural modifications

**Style Studio**: Click "Open Style Studio" for the full builder with all styles organized by category. Add custom feedback like "Make it more confident" to further guide generation. After generating, click "Edit Style" to adjust and regenerate.

### Feedback History & Cumulative Learning

The system tracks your feedback across generations and uses it to **incrementally improve** output quality:

- **Feedback is treated as requirements**, not suggestions
- Each feedback item is prefixed with **REQUIREMENT:** in the prompt
- Historical feedback accumulates, building a richer context
- **View Feedback** button shows your complete feedback trail
- Percentage changes tracked to show cumulative impact

### Content Edit Tracking

When you edit generated content, the system analyzes your changes:

- **Word count changes** — Did you add or remove substantial content?
- **Paragraph restructuring** — Did you reorganize the flow?
- **Sentence removal** — Which specific phrases were cut?

These edits inform the next regeneration with specific guidance like:
- "User ADDED substantial content — consider including more detail"
- "User REMOVED these sentences — avoid similar phrasing"
- "User RESTRUCTURED paragraphs — match this new organization"

**Edit Indicator**: Shows "Edited" badge when you've modified generated content, with Save and Discard buttons.

### Regenerate Confirmation

Before regenerating, a confirmation modal shows exactly what will change:

- New style tags being applied
- Style tags being removed
- Custom feedback additions
- Content type changes
- Edit analysis summary

This ensures you know precisely how your next generation will differ.

### Profile Persistence

- **Auto-load** — Returns to your saved profile automatically
- **Quick View** — Preview your profile while generating
- **Full Profile Modal** — View complete profile without losing context

### Save & Continue Editing

After generating content, you have flexible options:

- **Discard Edits** — Revert to the original generated version
- **Regenerate** — Generate a new version with your latest style settings
