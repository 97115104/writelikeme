## What It Does

Write Like Me solves the "AI slop" problem. When you use AI to generate text, it often sounds generic, formulaic, and obviously machine-generated. This tool analyzes your actual writing to understand your voice, then uses that understanding to generate content that sounds like you.

## Key Features

### Advanced Slop Detection & Removal

The heart of Write Like Me is its **comprehensive AI pattern detection system** based on extensive research into what makes AI writing sound artificial. The tool detects and removes:

**Critical Patterns (Always Fixed):**
- Em dashes and en dashes used as parentheticals
- Antithetical constructions ("It's not X, it's Y")
- Sycophantic phrases ("Great question!", "That's fascinating!")
- Bullet points and numbered lists (converted to flowing prose)
- Third-person self-references ("The post explores..." → "I explore...")

**High Priority Patterns:**
- Lazy declarative openers ("Here's the thing:", "The bottom line:")
- Colon-based declarations ("The answer is simple: X")
- Formulaic transitions (However, Moreover, Furthermore)
- Formulaic conclusions (In summary, At the end of the day)
- Meta-commentary ("As I mentioned above", "Let me explain")
- Rhetorical Q&A patterns
- "Real talk" openers ("Real talk:", "Full transparency:")
- Quick exit/cheap engagement lines ("not writing this for a quick exit")
- "Personal and universal" clichés

**Medium Priority Patterns:**
- Overly formal phrasing ("It is worth noting", "utilize", "leverage")
- AI vocabulary clusters (landscape, ecosystem, journey, robust)
- Forced perspective balancing ("On one hand... on the other hand")
- Passive voice constructions
- Engagement bait phrases

**Low Priority Patterns:**
- Excessive intensifiers (incredibly, absolutely, truly)
- Hedge word clusters (perhaps, maybe, might)
- Filler adjectives (various, numerous, significant)

**Formatting Issues:**
- Wall of text without paragraph breaks
- Very long paragraphs (150+ words)
- Excessive whitespace and spacing issues
- Extra long sentences (50+ words)

Generated text receives a **quality score from 0-100** showing how authentic it sounds. Text with critical or formatting issues is automatically fixed or rewritten to remove AI patterns while preserving your voice.

### Writing Profile Analysis

Share your writing samples and get a comprehensive analysis using research-backed frameworks:

- **Writing Mastery Level** — Based on the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition:
  - *Novice* → *Emerging* → *Competent* → *Proficient* → *Expert* → *Masterful*
- **Technical Level** — Literal grade/education equivalent (Grade 6-8 through Academic/Technical)
- **Voice Consistency** — How consistent your voice is across samples (1-10)
- **Pattern Density** — How many unique, replicable patterns were detected (1-10)
- **Lexical Diversity** — Vocabulary richness and variety (1-10)
- **Style** — Formality level, descriptiveness, directness, perspective
- **Tone & Voice** — Primary tone, emotional register, consistency
- **Stylistic Markers** — Unique patterns, signature phrases, punctuation preferences
- **Patterns to Replicate** — Key constructions that define your voice

### Profile Fidelity Score

Your profile quality is scored as a **fidelity percentage** indicating how closely generated content will match your actual writing:

- **95-100% (Exceptional)** — Output nearly indistinguishable from your actual writing
- **85-94% (High Fidelity)** — Core voice and style accurately captured with minor variations
- **70-84% (Good Match)** — Major stylistic elements captured; some idiosyncrasies may vary
- **50-69% (Moderate)** — General tone recognizable; specific markers may be inconsistent
- **30-49% (Partial)** — Basic patterns identified; output will have noticeable variations
- **<30% (Insufficient)** — Need more samples for reliable style matching

Scoring factors:
- Sample volume (number of writing samples)
- Content density (total word count)
- Sample depth (average words per sample)
- Source variety (different input types)
- Content diversity (topical variety)

### Scrivener Support

Write Like Me fully supports **Scrivener** projects:

- **Drag & drop .scriv folders** — Drop your entire Scrivener project folder directly onto the upload area
- **RTF file parsing** — Automatically extracts text from Scrivener's RTF format
- **Batch import** — Imports all documents from your Draft folder at once
- **Smart filtering** — Skips empty files and metadata, imports only your actual writing
- Source variety (different types of content)

### Platform-Aware Generation

Mention a social platform in your prompt and the tool automatically adapts:

- **X/Twitter** — Ultra-brief, 1-2 sentences, punchy
- **LinkedIn** — Professional but concise, 100-200 words max
- **Instagram** — Brief captions, 1-3 sentences
- **TikTok** — Ultra-short, hook-focused
- **Threads/Bluesky** — Brief takes, 2-4 sentences
- **Facebook** — Conversational but concise
- **Reddit** — Community-aware, varies by context
- **Email/Substack** — Professional structure

For professional platforms (LinkedIn, Email), you can choose to adjust capitalization, grammar, and formality while maintaining your voice.

### One-Click Sharing

After generating content for social media, share directly:
- **Share on X** — Opens X/Twitter with your content pre-filled
- **Share on LinkedIn** — Opens LinkedIn share dialog
- **Share on Facebook** — Opens Facebook share dialog
- **Share on Reddit** — Opens Reddit submission

If your prompt mentioned a URL, it's automatically appended for clean link sharing.

### GitHub Repo Detection

GitHub repository URLs in your prompt are automatically detected. The tool fetches:
- README content
- Repository metadata (description, language, stars)

This provides rich technical context when generating content about code projects.

### Style Sketch Studio

Based on your prompt content, the tool detects and suggests relevant tones with **sentiment-coded colors**:

| Color | Sentiment | Example Styles |

Toggle tones on/off to guide generation while preserving your core voice. Hover for descriptions. **Already-selected tags appear pre-checked** and can be toggled off.

**Smart Auto-Selection**: When writing personal text messages or emails with emotional content (birthday wishes, congratulations, thank you notes), the system automatically suggests **Emoji** and **Conversational** styles.

**Predicted Impact Heuristics**: Each style shows how it might affect your output:
- Word count changes (+/- percentage)
- Sentence length shifts  
- Structural modifications

**Style Studio**: Click "Open Style Studio" for the full builder with all styles organized by category. Add custom feedback like "Make it more confident" to further guide generation. After generating, click "Edit Style" to adjust and regenerate.

### Feedback History & Cumulative Learning

The system tracks your feedback across generations and uses it to **incrementally improve** output quality:

- **Feedback is treated as requirements**, not suggestions
- Each feedback item is prefixed with **REQUIREMENT:** in the prompt
- Historical feedback accumulates, building a richer context
- **View Feedback** button opens a modal showing your complete feedback trail
- Feedback count badge shows how many notes are active
- Percentage changes tracked to show cumulative impact

### Revision History

Track and restore previous versions of your generated content:

- **Clock icon button** — Access revision history (appears after first generation)
- **Version count badge** — Shows how many versions are saved
- **Version preview** — See word count, styles used, and content preview
- **Restore any version** — Click to restore a previous generation
- **Smart deduplication** — Clicking through history doesn't create duplicate entries
- **Current position tracking** — Shows which version you're currently viewing
- **Up to 20 revisions** stored per session

This allows you to experiment freely with regeneration, knowing you can always restore a version you liked better.

### Content Edit Tracking

When you edit generated content, the system analyzes your changes:

- **Word count changes** — Did you add or remove substantial content?
- **Paragraph restructuring** — Did you reorganize the flow?
- **Sentence removal** — Which specific phrases were cut?

These edits inform the next regeneration with specific guidance like:
- "User ADDED substantial content — consider including more detail"
- "User REMOVED these sentences — avoid similar phrasing"
- "User RESTRUCTURED paragraphs — match this new organization"

**Edit Indicator**: Shows "Edited" badge when you've modified generated content, with Save and Discard buttons.

### Regenerate Confirmation

After your first generation, if you've made changes (edits, feedback, or style adjustments), a confirmation modal shows exactly what will be applied:

- **Style tags** — Which tones will guide the generation
- **Feedback notes** — How many feedback items are active
- **Your edits** — Summary of content changes you made
- **New guidance** — Any custom feedback you've added
- **Impact estimates** — Percentage improvements for accuracy, relevance, and tone

The first generation always proceeds without confirmation. Subsequent generations only show confirmation when there are actual changes to apply.

### Profile Persistence
